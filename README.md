# Rock-paper-scissors-game
Essentially this is just a text based game, maybe with visual representations, Rock, Paper, Scissors where the user plays against the computer or another person, with scorekeeping and being able to replay multiple rounds.

The program will allow the user to play Rock, Paper, Scissors against the computer or another person. The user will input their choice of “rock,” “paper,” or “scissors,” and the computer will randomly select its choice using the Random module. The program will look at the two choices, determine the winner, and display the results. It will also keep track of scores and allow the user to play multiple rounds until they choose to quit. Other things will probably be added as I go.

In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?
The game correctly accepts user input, randomly generates the computer’s choice, determines the winner for each round, and displays the results, i just need to find a way to alternate between random computer choices and human input.

In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?
The program will track scores across multiple rounds, allow the user to play multiple games, and include input validation to prevent crashes from invalid input.

In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?
The program will include art or a basic GUI to make the game more visually appealing and interactive.

In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?
Next, I will take the user's input and generate random numbers with Random. I will practice loops to allow replaying rounds and conditionals to determine the winner. I may also research how to implement ASCII art or a simple GUI using Swing for visual enhancements. I am working individually.

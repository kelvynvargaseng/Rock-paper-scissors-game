## About the Game
This is a fun Rock-Paper-Scissors game made with Python and Tkinter. You can play against the computer or with a friend. Everything on the screen is colorful and animated to make it more fun.

Here’s what it can do:

- Single-player and multiplayer modes  
- Rainbow animated text for scores, results, and menus  
- Animated GIFs on the screen for cool visuals  
- Countdown timer for each round so you have to pick fast  
- Best-of-N rounds so you can decide how many rounds to play  
- Confetti effect when someone wins a round  
- Enter your name so the game feels personal  
- Score tracking for all players  
- Background animations for a lively look  

## How to Play / Run

1. Make sure Python 3.x is installed.  
2. Put all images (rock, paper, scissors, GIFs) in the same folder as game.py.  
3. Run the game by opening a terminal or command prompt and typing:

python game.py

4. Enter your name, pick your mode (single or multiplayer), and start playing.
